Project Name: Bridging the employability gap for international learners through integrated solutions.<br><br>


Thanks for taking time to learn about the research being conducted by Humber College. We thank you to support it by participating in the focus groups. This will be a win-win situation for both sides. By participating in this study, you are supporting a purpose to create impactful strategies that ensure international students are valued, understood, and able to grow personally and professionally. They will then be in a better position to contribute significantly to Canada’s growth. <br><br>

Our research project aims to comprehensively explore the challenges that international students face as they transition into the Canadian workforce. Recognizing the crucial roles played by government entities, educational institutions, community organizations, and the industry, our objective is to understand the complex interplay between these actors and how they collectively facilitate or hinder this transition. You as international student and/or a graduate are one of the critical stakeholder. By mapping your journey as international students/graduates across various educational levels and identifying key transition points and associated challenges, we seek to develop an integrated solution - a framework. This framework is designed to validate and align students' skills, competencies, and experiences with Canadian standards and expectations, thus smoothing their pathway into the workforce.<br><br>

Through tailored interventions, we aim to address these challenges, enabling international students to fully leverage their education and opportunities in Canada. This effort not only benefits the students by fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment but also contributes to Canada’s socio-economic growth by tapping into a diverse talent pool. Ultimately, our project supports Canada's talent retention goals, promotes innovation, and enhances the country's global competitiveness and reputation as a premier destination for international education. <br><br>

Thank you for your interest and contribution to this important research.</p>
